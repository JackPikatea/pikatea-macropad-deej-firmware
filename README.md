# pikatea-macropad-deej-firmware
deej firmware sketches for Pikatea Macropad for GB1, GB2 and GB3

TODO
* Bring all the documentation here
* Clean up the code so that it can easily be expanded to macropad with buttons of different ammounts
* Clean up the code so that it is clear what should be edited. (probably split the firmware up into multiple files)
* eat a burrito
